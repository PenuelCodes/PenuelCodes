### Oh, hello there ðŸ‘‹

 I'm a JavaScript Engineer from Nigeria ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¬. 

I specialize in cross-platform development using technologies such as React , Node and TypeScript.


With that in mind, I also have a full-stack background from working on the web as well as on the back-end, primarily using Node.JS, MongoDB and of course React.


This is all very helpful when I find myself working alone on a project, which unfortunately happens more often than not.


If I'm not spending long hours trying to fix bugs, I'm likely staring at charts, trading digital currencies.
