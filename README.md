### Hi, I'm Penuel ðŸ‘‹


I'm a JavaScript Engineer from Nigeria ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¬ in love with React and Node.

 I'm actively looking for my first great Web Development position. I'd love to work in the Kansas City Metro area or remotely, but I'm open to relocation. The Pacific Northwest looks so lovely!

ðŸŒ±    I'm working on growing and expanding my skills and knowledge through small projects.

ðŸ’¬
