### Oh, hello there ðŸ‘‹

 
I once wrote a great program in Javascript. It printed "hello world" to the console. Ever since then, my code has been getting progressively better and every night when I go to bed, I calculate exactly how long it will be till Iâ€™m writing code again. 



With that in mind, I also have a full-stack background from working on the web as well as on the back-end, primarily using Node.JS, MongoDB and of course React.


This is all very helpful when I find myself working alone on a project, which unfortunately happens more often than not.


If I'm not spending long hours trying to fix bugs, I'm likely staring at charts, trading digital currencies.
