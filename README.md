### Oh, hello there ðŸ‘‹

 
I once wrote a great program in Javascript. It printed "hello world" to the console. Ever since then, my code has been getting progressively better and every night when I go to bed, I calculate exactly how long it will be till Iâ€™m writing code again. 



I specialize in cross-platform development using technologies such as React , Node and TypeScript. I am obsessed with the idea of using software to solve practical problems and most importantly, I'm enthusiastic about growing and gaining new skills on my software development  journey . I value learning from others, genuine connections and hearing about other people's passions and how I can possibly help. 
Two of my favorite Programming books are You Don't Know JS: Scope & Closures  by Kyle Simpson and  Speaking JavaScript: An In-Depth Guide for Programmers by Axel Rauschmayer.



This is all very helpful when I find myself working alone on a project, which unfortunately happens more often than not.


If I'm not spending long hours trying to fix bugs, I'm likely staring at charts, trading digital currencies.
